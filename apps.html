                            <p> Been pretty busy with learning React and Neural networks lately. I'm going to probably have to take a 
                                a break from personal projects since my internship starts soon, but on a high note I designed a virtual 
                            escape room with one of my friends, <a href = "https://andrewtacozhang.com"> Andrew</a>, and we're hoping to 
                            trial run it and then market it to the general population. I'm realizing that my weak points in project development 
                            at the moment is hosting and design, the former of which is easier to learn. As part of my internship, as well as personally, 
                            I've been learning more about Azure, so hopefully I can move from static websites to more complex dynamic apps as well 
                            as deploying entire pipelines and neural networks on them. </p>

                            <p> As per my April 28 blog entry, I worked on making a scheduler app for high schoolers 
                                and college students. This was inspired by my sister who had often asked me to help her figure 
                                out her gpa and by the current coronavirus pandemic's effect on the college system. Many colleges 
                                have changed their grading system and it can become hard to understand the effect a P/NP grade will have 
                                on your GPA, a concern for many students entering a receeding job market. I also made a Flask Application 
                                that helps people use the Spotify API to find songs that match keys and tempo to help with mixes. </p>

                                ideas for projects I want to work on in the future; I want to build a webapp using React 
                            to help students plan out their schedules better, build a machine learning bot using neural networks 
                            to automatically swipe left and right on tinder and build (yet another) Spotify app, but this time 
                            attempt to host develop and bring it to market.  </p>

                                the same domain name so that is a potential option to consider. I am working to develop
                                a Flask application to help with music mixing, utilizing Pandas and the Spotify API, as 
                                well as exploring the Tinder API to create a machine learning model for preferences. </p>

                                This was my first attempt at designing a web app in Javascript; I had previously done work in Flask, but I had 
                                never been able to successfully host a Flask Application on a server. I figured that I might try to learn 
                                Javascript in an attempt to make hosting easier, and to learn how to build full scale web apps, with the goal of learning 
                                the front end interface and then braching off into integrating routing, databases and more. This app is a single 
                                page application meant to help students with planning out their academic careers, and specifically with helping them 
                                calculate their GPA's.

                                This was a really fun web app to make that lets people play inside of a murder mystery to solve 
                                challenges and find out who the real killer is. This came as an idea from quarantine, and the premise 
                                of the story somewhat reflects the environment we were in when we were designing it. Overall it was a lot 
                                of trial and error with React and React Router, and a fun way to gain more exposure in how to use the 
                                features that React Router has and the added functionality it provides on top of React.
