                   I never knew him personally, but the type of person he seemed to be and the effect he had on the people around 
                   him was abundantly apparent. On his website he talked about the importance of acknowledging ones own failures 
                   and I hope that my attempt at this does some justice to his memory. </p>

                                <p> I joined The Berkeley Forum my freshmen year of college. It was one of two clubs 
                                    I had joined upon coming to Cal, and the people in the club were some of the most 
                                    motivated, aware and intelligent people on campus. I helped the club with technology 
                                    at events, setting up audio equipment and managing most of the our general technology
                                    equipment. </p> 
                                <p> However, my failure came at my leadership in the Technology Committee, where I 
                                    did not progress the committee as I had hoped to do. I had wanted for members to learn more 
                                    and hold workshops and begin working on projects that could help the club as a whole, but 
                                    ultimately had nothing to show for my time over the semester. I'm glad to see the technology committee 
                                    has since recruited some amazing new members who have done some great projects, and helped 
                                    contrbute to the great club that The Berkeley Forum is </p>

                                <p> At the end of freshmen year, I had begun taking an interest in machine learning, specifically 
                                    with more advanced techniques and stacks, due mostly to my time interning with CyberCube. I had 
                                    first hand seen a lot of the cool work that could be done with Spark and distrubted computing 
                                    and AWS's machine learning frameworks. One of my friend's dads had told me in a brief encounter 
                                    that he was woring on developing machine learning models for realtime analysis of body movements for 
                                    sports using videos that coaches or players recording, an idea that combined my passion for videography,
                                    machine learning and sports </p>
                                <p> All in all, this unpaid opportunity was the perfect fit for me. I talked with the founder of the 
                                    product (the friend's dad) and had even begun to do some work with it. Unfortunately, I ran out of time 
                                    during my sophomore year, and began to neglect the responsibilities and despite trying on and off for more 
                                    than a half a year I hadn't done as much as I had hoped, or I was expected to. I regret that I squandered 
                                    the opportunity to this extent. It was a good learning opportunity for me not to overcommit, a tendency I have
                                    that arises from overconfidence, and I will keep this in mind for future opportunites. The company, Bomotix, 
                                    is doing amazing work and I highly recommend checking them out and I hope that someday in the future when I have 
                                    more time I can return to the company and help them develop their vision even more.
